# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Request: The client, a US telecom company, has been seeing its customers churn at an
alarming rate. They would like to know why, and also how to reduce it.

After a thorough data cleaning process, a simple calculation shows that out of the 6,687
customers, 26.86% canceled their subscription. For a service provider, this rate is a severe
burden for the company’s growth. It is important to note for later that more than half of the
users are using a Month-to-Month contract.

We found out that fortunately, 98% of the customers who are churning leave a reason, as it
is a mandatory field required in the cancellation process. This allows us to dive into the
“why”. 48.26% of the churn reasons are because users got converted by a competitor.
18.17% of the churners got attracted by competitors' plans and 17.81% because they had
better devices. The company’s staff’s attitude is also responsible for 17.21% of the total
churn. This is what the users told us, but what about other patterns?

Looking at the map, we can see that most States have a churn rate around the average.
However, there is an outstanding outlier, in the state of California. That state has a churn
rate 2.3 times higher than the average, at 63.24%.

On this other map, the bubble size shows the average number of customer service calls.
Despite having the highest churn rate, users in California call the company’s customer
service less. This shows that there is room for improvement. We could suggest looking for
a better way to support the customers in that state.

Users tend to be on the senior side, making 44% of the total users. Their churn rate is
10% higher than the average. We can see that the rate peaks above 40% for users above
70 years old. Out of 1,796 churners, only 6 cancellations were due to the customers’
death, meaning there should be a way to make senior customers more loyal.

The family plan graph shows what might be a strong correlation between the monthly
charged fee, and the churn rate. Indeed, people who are not in a family plan pay 10€
more monthly. One out of three of them churn, compared to less than one out of ten for
users in a family plan.

The payment method looks strongly correlated to the churn rate and the contract duration. Almost 40%
of users who decide to pay by paper check tend to cancel the service, for an average contract of 19
months. Credit card and direct debit customers stay almost 3 years on average. However, 34.5% of
direct debit users churn, against less than 15% for users paying by credit card. The contract length
graph also shows that users with yearly contracts are more reliable. Only 6.6% of them cancel their
subscription, against almost half for monthly contract users.

While customers using more than 5 GB of data per month have a relatively high churn rate whether
they have an unlimited plan or not, low data users (less than 5 GB / month) logically tend to churn
more if they have unlimited data. Since their churn rate is low (12.31%) if they have the adequate plan,
reaching out to them to downgrade their plan is advisable.

Finally, customers having an international plan but are not actively using it have a towering churn rate
of 71.2% against 7.6% for active users. On the other hand, customers without such a plan but actively
calling internationally have a 40% churn rate, against 20% for non-users.

## Conclusion & Solution

Here are some advices or points the company could improve in order to reduce its customer churn
rate:
● Adjust the company’s offers to reduce churn due to competitors’ better rates, devices, plan, and
download speeds.
● Improve their customer service with training on attitude, and ensure clients are contacted more
regularly regarding their current plan and needs.
● Proceed with a targeted analysis on the state of California, as it appears customers there are
following different patterns.
● Make a special senior plan
● Open group plan to friends
● Contact existing clients to switch to long term contract and credit card payment, and lead new
customers toward those.
● Contact low data users to suggest downgrading their plan.
● Contact customers to see if they are satisfied with their international or local plan, to ensure they
have the appropriate plan to their needs and reduce the chance of cancellation
